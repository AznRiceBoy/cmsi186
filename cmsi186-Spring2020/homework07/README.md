# CMSI 186: Homework Assignment #7
## More Problems About Estimation
### [Familiarity with Probability Estimation]
### Assignment Due: Monday, 2019-04-20

<blockquote>
Learning Outcomes: Students will (1) implement probability calculation which solves a well-known problem; (2) be able to write their own test framework code from scratch; (3) get a chance to think analytically about a problem and use their program to verify their thinking; and (4) get more practice documenting their code using the <q>javadocs</q> tool. 
</blockquote>

#### For this homework, you must accomplish the following activities:

Make a Java program, <em><code>BirthdaySolver.java</code></em>, for estimating the probability that among <code>N</code> randomly chosen people, at least two share a birthday.
* The value of <code><em>N</em></code> will be specified as a command line argument
* You should ignore birthdays that fall on February 29, e.g., assume that they have been uniformly distributed among the other 365 days of the year
* Solve this problem analytically in your head, as well as programmatically &ndash; and make sure that your program and your analysis confirm one another!
* Your program should be able to simulate one million experiments or more, and provide feedback to the user if it is taking a long time
* Make sure that you handle any errors that arise from user input, as usual
* Write a test harness Java program which is similar to the ones you have been provided this semester and use it to run your program.  Redirect its output to a text file.
* Write a short research report that explains, in one paragraph, how your mental analysis of the problem helped you develop your program.
* Use the <q>javadocs</p> tool to produce a set of documentation for this project; make sure there are no errors when you run the tool on your program code.
